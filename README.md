# Car-Workshop-Simulation

This is term project for the course - "Simulation & Modeling". In this project, we did analysis on how our system (Car Worshop) works i.e. we did a performance analysis of the system. In this system, there were various facilities with preassigned tasks like:

1. Routine Maintenance
2. Parts Replacement
3. Denting
4. Furnishing
5. Car Wash

The simulation will be running for 12 hours. The cars will arrive and will go through the facilities one by one then depart from the workshop
